{"context": "Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically formed through tectonic forces. The most common process is the collision of continental plates, which pushes rock layers upward to create fold mountains, such as the Himalayas. Some mountains also form from volcanic activity when magma rises to the surface and solidifies. Mountains often influence climate by blocking winds and causing orographic rainfall. They are usually characterized by steep slopes, high elevation, and rugged terrain. Over time, weathering and erosion gradually reshape mountain structures, carving ridges, valleys, and sharp peaks. Human settlements in mountainous regions are limited due to thin soils, steep gradients, and cold climates, but these areas may offer valuable minerals and tourism opportunities.", "question": "Which geological process most commonly forms large fold mountains such as the Himalayas?", "options": {"A": "Accumulation of wind-blown sediments", "B": "Collision of continental tectonic plates", "C": "Rapid chemical weathering of bedrock", "D": "Cooling of lava from shield volcanoes"}, "correct_answer": "B", "topic": "Physical Geography", "subtopic": "Landforms", "difficulty": "Easy"}

River valleys usually develop a V-shape as flowing water cuts downward through rock over millions of years. In contrast, glacial valleys feature a U-shape because the slow movement of massive ice sheets scours and widens the valley floor. Valleys often serve as important routes for transportation and human settlement due to fertile soils and access to freshwater. The formation of a valley depends on local climate, rock type, and the erosional agent involved. Rivers in humid regions carve deeper channels, while glaciers dominate in cold climates. Over time, valleys may broaden as the sides undergo weathering and mass movement processes.", "question": "What primary process creates V-shaped valleys?", "options": {"A": "Wind abrasion", "B": "River erosion", "C": "Glacial scouring", "D": "Volcanic deposition"}, "correct_answer": "B", "topic": "Physical Geography", "subtopic": "Landforms", "difficulty": "Easy"}

They may form through tectonic uplift, where large crustal blocks are pushed upward without significant folding. Another major process is volcanic activity: repeated lava flows can accumulate to create extensive volcanic plateaus, such as the Deccan Plateau in India. Plateaus differ from mountains in their broad, level surfaces and from plains in their higher elevation. Over time, rivers may cut deep canyons through plateaus, revealing geological history in exposed rock layers.

{"context": "Mechanical weathering refers to the physical breakdown of rocks without changing their chemical composition. Key processes include freeze-thaw weathering, exfoliation, root wedging, and abrasion. Freeze-thaw occurs in climates where temperatures fluctuate around freezing: water enters cracks, freezes, expands, and widens the fractures. Thermal expansion and contraction cause exfoliation in hot desert climates. Mechanical weathering increases the surface area of rocks, allowing chemical weathering to act more effectively. It is especially important in cold or arid climates where moisture is limited. Over time, mechanical weathering contributes to soil formation by producing smaller particles from parent rock.", "question": "Which of the following processes is an example of mechanical weathering?", "options": {"A": "Carbonation", "B": "Oxidation", "C": "Freeze-thaw action", "D": "Hydration"}, "correct_answer": "C", "topic": "Physical Geography", "subtopic": "Soils", "difficulty": "Easy"}
