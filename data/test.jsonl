{"context": "Mantle convection is the primary mechanism driving the motion of tectonic plates. Heat from Earth’s core causes mantle material to rise, while cooler, denser material sinks, creating convection currents. These currents push and pull on the lithospheric plates above them. Where mantle material rises, divergent boundaries form, leading to sea-floor spreading and volcanic activity. Where mantle material sinks, convergent boundaries and subduction zones develop. Hotspots, such as those that formed the Hawaiian Islands, are created by stationary plumes of hot mantle rock rising toward the surface, independent of plate boundaries.
